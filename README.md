# üîê Investigating Crypto-Related Crimes: Challenges & Opportunities  

This repository contains a **10-minute video presentation** exploring the **challenges and opportunities of investigating cryptocurrency-related crimes**, with a focus on law enforcement‚Äôs use of blockchain analysis tools.  

## üìå Overview  
Cryptocurrency-related crimes cover a wide range of illegal activities, including:  
- üíä Drug and pornography trade  
- üí∏ Money laundering  
- üïµÔ∏è Theft of digital assets  
- üë§ Fraud and identity-related crime  

The decentralized and often anonymous nature of cryptocurrencies presents **unique challenges** for law enforcement, but also creates **new opportunities** through blockchain forensics and regulatory frameworks.  

## üß© Key Topics Discussed  
### ‚ö†Ô∏è Challenges  
- **Anonymity** in cryptocurrencies: privacy coins (e.g., Monero), decentralized exchanges, mixers.  
- **Jurisdictional issues**: the global nature of cryptocurrency vs. nationally regulated financial systems.  
- **Advanced privacy features**: Monero‚Äôs ring signatures, RingCT, and stealth addresses.  

### ‚úÖ Opportunities  
- **Blockchain forensic tools**: Chain analysis software (e.g., OXT.me, Blockchain.com) to trace illicit transactions.  
- **Regulatory developments**: Know Your Customer (KYC) requirements, transaction monitoring, and exchange registration.  
- **Successful law enforcement cases**: Crackdowns on Bitcoin-related crime in Australia and globally.  

## üîç Case Studies & Demonstrations  
- **Bitcoin vs. Monero Privacy**  
  - Bitcoin‚Äôs public blockchain vs. Monero‚Äôs privacy-enhancing features.  
  - Why criminals shift from Bitcoin to privacy coins.  

- **Binance Hack Example**  
  - $570M theft traced through blockchain forensics.  
  - Demonstration of **OXT.me** showing transaction flow, wallet addresses, and anonymization attempts.  
  - Use of mixers and wallet generators by hackers, and how law enforcement responds.
